This was a completely different task for me, as at first i could not even understand anything neither in the code nor in the instructions becase the language was totally new for me. But after some time when i tried to understand the syntax and when i run it, i was understanding a little where to go. And then just resolved the issues displayed by the text editor and understanding a little bit it got clear.
